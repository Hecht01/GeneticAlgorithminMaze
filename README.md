# GeneticAlgorithminMaze
This is a University Project for my SK2 (Symboic AI 2) Course. It is an implementation of a Genetic Algorithm that is supposed to solve a Maze.
Genes are implemented as a list of commands S, E, N, and W (south, east, north, west). The mutation is implemented via the Random library, as is  Cross-over. 
The Algorithm uses the A* Algorithm to calculate fitness based on distance to goal node. Visualization and agent system made with agentPy.

My partner was Eva-Maria Mauerer.
